Challenges during the integration of Excalidraw Collab into a TypeScript/React project have resulted in these problems


Problem Description:

On attempting to utilize the Excalidraw component by importing it in the TypeScript/React application have encountered the following TypeScript error:
Excalidraw cannot be used as a JSX component.
Its type 'MemoExoticComponent<ForwardRefExoticComponent<PublicExcalidrawProps & RefAttributes<ExcalidrawAPIRefValue>>>' is not a valid JSX element type.
Type 'MemoExoticComponent<ForwardRefExoticComponent<PublicExcalidrawProps & RefAttributes<ExcalidrawAPIRefValue>>>' is not assignable to type '(props: any, deprecatedLegacyContext?: any) => ReactNode'.
Type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>> | null' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
Type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
Property 'children' is missing in type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>' but required in type 'ReactPortal'.ts(2786)
index.d.ts(176, 9): 'children' is declared here.
Excalidraw is not defined.


Previous Issue:
Before encountering this issue, I dealt with the following error:
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
But the Excalidraw is indeed exported from index.tsx. This exact issue is also faced by "Joshua-onwuzu" here


Changes made in the codebase:
- Updated the .env.
- Updated the webpack entry to ../../excalidraw-app/index.tsx.
- yarn install, did some yarn add to resolve some throttle not found errors and SVG errors.
- And yarn run pack
- Executed npm link in the packages/excalidraw path.
- Used npm link @excalidraw/excalidraw in another React/TypeScript project.


I have also experimented with different versions of Excalidraw, attempting to use it in both JSX and TSX React projects. Unfortunately, still dealing with these errors.
